# Neural network Embedding All the Things (NEAT)

NEAT is a flexible pipeline for,
- Parsing a graph serialization
- Generating embeddings
- Training Classifiers
- Making predictions
- Creating well formatted output and metrics for the predictions

This pipeline has [KGX](https://github.com/biolink/kgx) and [Embiggen](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/embiggen) as major dependencies.
